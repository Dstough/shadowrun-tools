# Game Concepts
Shadowrun is a game of pitting a team of skilled outsiders up against the vast array of challenges the setting will throw at them.
The players usually have a job to do; the game is about their creativity in designing a plan to do it, then trying to pull off that plan without it going too far wrong.
The rules of Shadowrun are built around a few core essentials, namely that you should be throwing nice handfuls of D6s to see what happens, and chaos is always lurking nearby.
These rules exist to help contain and direct the chaos—but not fully control it, because who has full control over what the dice do?
To look at how the game works, let’s knock out a few basics first.

## The Primary Roles In The Game
There are two main roles: player and gamemaster (GM).
The players have a character (PC) they represent in the game.
They are the ones who have adventures, going out and taking on shadowrun jobs and using the skills they have to succeed.
The gamemaster sets up the framework of the adventure and controls a number of characters (NPCs) the PCs encounter and interact with.
They keep the story moving, providing the incentives and opposition that make the PCs' lives interesting.

### Players and The Gamemaster Working Together
The goal of a role-playing game is to use the players, gamemaster, and dice to tell a story with unexpected twists and drama.
The gamemaster is there to help the players see the story unfold and be neutral arbiter of the rules.
The dice are there to resolve uncertanty during a scene.
Sometimes the runners will succeed by the skin of their teeth, sometimes they’ll fail and need to scramble to make up for it.
All of these elements can be part of a memorable game, so it’s the job of everyone playing the game to make the unfolding plot fun and memorable.
Games tend to work best when everyone looks out for the fun of the group, rather than advancing their goals at the cost of everyone else’s.
The **Running the Game** chapter has more thoughts on how the GM can build plots and create an environment enjoyable for everyone.

### During a Shadowrun Game
The player characters work as a team and get hired by Mr. Johnson (the pseudonym used by people contracting runs), scope out the job, do the legwork, and then carry out their plan.
Depending on the complexity of the job, it may cover multiple gaming sessions.
The way they pull off the run, the people they help, and the people they hurt can set the stage for future missions and plot developments.
As a game session progresses, players will meet obstacles or have the chance to use their skills to carry out their plan.

## The Dice To Use
Shadowrun exclusivly uses six-sided dice for every roll that is made.",
Throughout the text, six-sided dice are abbreviated as D6, sometimes with a number in front telling you how many dice are to be rolled.
*For example: "3D6" would mean three six-sided dice are to be rolled.*

When dice are rolled the number of 5s and 6s that are rolled are counted.
This count is the total number of **Hits** generated by the roll.
On rare occation the numbers rolled on each die in the pool may need to be summed up.
This will be made explicitly clear in the section where it is required.

The number of dice rolled is called a **Dice Pool.**
It is made up of a skill and a linked attribute.
The numerical values of each are added together to form the dice pool.
Some rolls may call for two attributes to be added together, or to add the same attribute twice.
Additional modifiers, both positive and negative may also be applied to the dice pool based on situational circumstances.
All these numbers summed together form a final count for the dice pool, this is called a **Test.**

## Tests
In a Shadowrun game, certain tasks have variable levels of difficulty and not guarenteed to succeed.
To see if a PC accomplishes these kind of goals, it will call for a test to be made.
When a dice pool is generated and the dice are rolled, the resulting hits are compared to a number to determin success.
The number is determined by three different types of test: Simple, Opposed, and Extended.

### Simple Tests
> [ Skill + Attribute ( Threshold ) ]

A simple test has a target number that the character must meet or exceed with the hits generated by their test.
In some instances, the number of net hits above the threshold have an effect on the action.

### Opposed Test
> [ Skill + Attribute vs. Skill + Attribute ]

An opposed test has a target number set by the net hits of another test rolled by a different dice pool.
This other pool can come from another character or could be set by the rating of some device or structure.
The net hits usually dictate the outcome of opposed tests.
If there are no net hits after the check, the action taken usually fails.

### Extended Test
> [ Skill + Attribute ( Threshold, Interval ) ]

Extended tests are similar to simple tests but they take place over a longer period of time.
This type of test may need to be rolled multiple times to complete and each role takes an amount of time specified by the test.
Each time a roll is made after the first time the test's dice pool is reduced by 1.
If the dice pool is reduced to 0 the test has failed and all progress made towards the task is lost.

### Teamwork Tests
Multiple characters can help each other out with a check.
One character is designated as the leader of the action.
The characters helping in the task makes the same check the action would normally require.
They keep track of the net hits and the leader adds that many dice to his pool when the test is made.
If the characters are acting in initative order, the helpers must roll their test before the leader does.
If any other action is taken by the helper before the leader makes their test, the bonus dice from that helper is lost.

### Buying Hits
If certain actions need to be expidited or a player simply doesn't want to trust the roll of the dice, they can elect to buy hits for the test.
For every 4 dice that are in the pool 1 net hit is generated by the test.
When hits are bought there are no dice rolled, any additional dice past the interval of 4 do not contribute at all.

### Trying Again
Certain tests can be attempted multiple times if the inital attempt failed.
As long as there is no immediate threat or imposing consequence from failure, The test may be attempted again.
Each time a failed test is repeated the dice pool is reduced by 2.
If the dice pool is reduced to 0 or less then the test cannot be attempted again.

## Character Traits
There are many different aspects that make up a character.
Each of them contribute to game play in different ways and all of them are important to the game.
They run the full range from attributes and skills to equipment and lifestyle.
They are the defining aspects of every character in the game.

### Attributes

#### (B)ody:
The attribute that determins how sturdy the character is.

The reaction score is also used in piloting vehicles and drones.

#### (S)trength:

It contributes to the damage dealt by melee weapons wielded by the character.
The strength score also contributes to certain skill tests and certain weapons require a minimum score to use.

#### (W)illpower:
The attribute that determins the characters ability to focus their concentration.
