# Chapter 1
Section text will allow you to have a title.
Each string in the json will append as a sentance.

A paragraph tag will start a new paragraph.
You cannot have a title before a paragraph.

## Nested Section Title
The section type will start a new paragraph and allow you to have a title.
Each nested section will scale down header tag of the title.

### Sub-section

#### A section doesn't need entries:
##### Italic Bold Title:
**You can bold specific sentances as well.**
*Also, italisize them.*
~~Hell, I'll let you strike them out.~~

> You can nest a section in a paragraph and vice versa.
> Paragrahps don't scale down the title.
