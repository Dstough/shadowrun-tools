        <h1>Shadowrun: Jackpoint Edition</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        After the recent dissapointing release of more recent editions of shadowrun, I decided to write my own version of the shadowrun rule set.
        The plan for Jackpoint is to serve as a living rulebook library.
        There will be updates made to the game manuals hosted on this site as time goes on.
        All the changes will be posted to the change log and they will each have an explanation.
        The reader page is set up to be easy to print specific sections of the rules but it is preferable to just use the site for rules references as you play.
